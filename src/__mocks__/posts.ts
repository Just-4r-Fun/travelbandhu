        postDescription: "Solang valley is a paradise for adventure and sports lovers. While you are here, you can test your skills with a pair of skis or explore by snowmobile.  When the weather warms up, people flock to zorbing and paragliding. You can also take a cable car and enjoy a fascinating view of the Himalayas. If you are looking for snow sports and activities, winters are the best time to visit. while the summer months are ideal for other adventure sports.The precipitous falls of the Jogini falls are a short and difficult walk away from the main city of Manali. The path to the waterfall is panoramic and offers a glimpse of the Beas River and the snow-capped peaks of Rohtang. In addition to the serene setting, Jogini is also an important pilgrimage site and you can visit many ancient shrines around the pool at the bottom.  An early departure is recommended so that you can spend more time in this picturesque natural site, which is one of the best places to visit in Manali for excursions and picnics.",
